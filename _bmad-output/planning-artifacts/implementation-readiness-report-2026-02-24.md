**Project:** GopherShip

### UX Design Documents Files Found

**Status:** No UX Design documents found.
_Note: This is expected given the systems middleware nature of GopherShip, provided `gs-ctl` is CLI-only._

## Issues Found

- **Duplicates**: None.
- **Missing Documents**: 
    - ⚠️ WARNING: UX Design document not found. If there are UI components planned, this will be a gap.

## Confirmation Required

I will use the whole documents listed above for the readiness assessment.
